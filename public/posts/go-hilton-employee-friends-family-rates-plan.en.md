## Understanding the Hilton Employee Rate Plan

### Exclusive Perks for Hilton's Workers
If you work for Hilton, this rate plan is like a big "thank you" gift. You can stay at Hilton hotels for way less than the normal price. It's a great chance to enjoy the nice stuff you help offer to guests every day.

The discount can change. It depends on where the hotel is, what time of the year it is, and what kind of room you want. But usually, employees can save anywhere from 30% to 70% off the regular room rate. That's a really big deal! It means you can stay in those super - fancy Hilton hotels that you might have only thought about in your dreams before.

### Booking Process
Booking a room as an employee is pretty easy - peasy. You just log into the special employee website that Hilton has. Once you're in, there's a reservation system waiting for you. You type in when you want to travel, where you want to go, and how many rooms you need. Then, the system shows you all the rooms that are available and how much they cost with the discount. You can pick from different room types. Whether you want a simple, cozy room or a really luxurious suite, it's up to you and your budget.

### Encouraging Employee Feedback
When employees get to stay at Hilton hotels, it's not just for fun. Hilton also wants them to give some feedback. After the stay, employees can say what they liked and what could be better. This feedback is really important for Hilton because it helps them keep their high - quality service and make it even better.

## The Friends & Family Rate Plan

### Sharing the Goodness
The Friends & Family Rate Plan is a really nice thing Hilton does. It lets employees share this great deal with their friends and family. It's a way to make their loved ones happy and also get more people to talk about how great Hilton is.

The discount for friends and family isn't as big as the employee one, but it's still pretty good. Usually, they can save around 20% to 50% off the regular price. That's enough to make staying at a Hilton hotel a much more affordable and attractive choice.

### Verification and Booking
To use this plan, the employee has to prove that the person booking is really their friend or family. They can do this with a special code or by filling out a form that says how they're related. Once that's done, the friend or family member can book the room at the special rate on the Hilton website or by calling the hotel.

## Stories of Those Who've Used the Rate Plans

### The Employee's Dream Holiday
Meet Sarah. She works at the front desk of a Hilton hotel in Los Angeles. After working long hours for years, she finally decided to use her employee rate plan for a holiday she'd always dreamed of - going to the Hilton resort in the Maldives.

She said, "I couldn't believe it when I saw how much I could save. I'd always looked at pictures of the Maldives and thought it was too expensive. But with the employee rate, it suddenly became possible. When I walked into that over - water bungalow and saw the clear water under me, it was like a dream come true. And the service at the resort was just as good as I thought it would be from working at Hilton. I even told them a few little things I thought could be better, and they were really happy to hear it. It was an experience I'll never forget."

### A Family Reunion at Hilton
John, who works at a Hilton hotel in London, used the Friends & Family Rate Plan to plan a family reunion. His family from all over the world had been wanting to get together, but the cost of hotels was always a problem.

He booked a bunch of rooms at a Hilton hotel in a central spot. His aunt, who had never stayed in a fancy hotel before, was really excited. "When we got to the hotel, I was blown away," she said. "The lobby was so beautiful, and the staff was so nice. And the fact that we got such a good deal because of John was just amazing. We had a great family reunion, and the hotel's pool and restaurant made it even more special."

John said, "It was great to see my family having such a good time. And I felt really proud that I could use my connection with Hilton to make this happen. It made me realize how much this rate plan can bring people together."

### A Business Trip with a Difference
Mark, who works in Hilton's corporate office, had to go to a business conference in New York. Instead of staying in a regular business hotel, he used his employee rate plan to stay at the Hilton Midtown Manhattan.

He said, "I knew Hilton well, but staying there for my business trip was a whole new experience. The hotel was in a great location for the conference, and because of the discount, I could get a bigger room with a view of the city. After long days of meetings, it was so nice to come back to a comfortable place. And the hotel's business facilities, like the fast Wi - Fi and the meeting rooms, were really good. It made my business trip feel more like a fun trip, and I got to enjoy the city in a more luxurious way."
